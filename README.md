**OpenEBS** is the most widely deployed and easy to use open-source storage solution for Kubernetes.

**OpenEBS** is the leading open-source example of a category of cloud native storage solutions sometimes called [Container Attached Storage](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2018/04/19/container-attached-storage-a-primer/). **OpenEBS** is listed as an open-source example in the [CNCF Storage White Paper](https://github.com/cncf/tag-storage/blob/master/CNCF%20Storage%20Whitepaper%20V2.pdf) under the hyperconverged storage solutions.

Some key aspects that make OpenEBS different compared to other traditional storage solutions:
- Built using the micro-services architecture like the applications it serves. OpenEBS is itself deployed as a set of containers on Kubernetes worker nodes. Uses Kubernetes itself to orchestrate and manage OpenEBS components.
- Built completely in userspace making it highly portable to run across any OS/platform.
- Completely intent-driven, inheriting the same principles that drive the ease of use with Kubernetes.
- OpenEBS supports a range of storage engines so that developers can deploy the storage technology appropriate to their application design objectives. Distributed applications like Cassandra can use the LocalPV engine for lowest latency writes. Monolithic applications like MySQL and PostgreSQL can use the ZFS engine (cStor) for resilience. Streaming applications like Kafka can use the NVMe engine [Mayastor](https://github.com/openebs/Mayastor) for best performance in edge environments. Across engine types, OpenEBS provides a consistent framework for high availability, snapshots, clones and manageability.

# Deployment
OpenEBS itself is deployed as just another container on your host and enables storage services that can be designated on a per pod, application, cluster or container level, including:
- Automate the management of storage attached to the Kubernetes worker nodes and allow the storage to be used for Dynamically provisioning OpenEBS Replicated or Local PVs.
- Data persistence across nodes, dramatically reducing time spent rebuilding Cassandra rings for example.
- Synchronous replication of volume data across availability zones improving availability and decreasing attach/detach times for example.
- A common layer so whether you are running on AKS, or your bare metal, or GKE, or AWS - your wiring and developer experience for storage services is as similar as possible.
- Backup and Restore of volume data to and from S3 and other targets.

An added advantage of being a completely Kubernetes native solution is that administrators and developers can interact and manage OpenEBS using all the wonderful tooling that is available for Kubernetes like kubectl, Helm, Prometheus, Grafana, Weave Scope, etc.

**Our vision** is simple: let storage and storage services for persistent workloads be fully integrated into the environment so that each team and workload benefits from the granularity of control and Kubernetes native behaviour.

## Roadmap (as of Jan 2024)
OpenEBS is 100% open source software. 
The project source code is spread across multiple repos and covers multiple projects: 
<BR>
<BR>
Our main Roadmap is focused exclusively on the modern (STANDARD Edition) Data-Engine **Mayastor**. It does not define any net-new features or capabilities for any LEGACY projects or projects that are tagged & defined as DEPRECATED or ARCHIVED. Currently those projects are defined as the follows (see references above for the details on the projects DEPRECATED and ARCHIVAL strategy)...
- Jiva
- cStor
- NFS-Provisioner
<BR>

**MayaStor Roadmap
[2024 Roadmap](https://github.com/openebs/openebs/blob/main/ROADMAP.md) 


## Scalability

OpenEBS can scale to include an arbitrarily large number of containerized storage controllers. Kubernetes is used to provide fundamental pieces such as using etcd for inventory. OpenEBS scales to the extent your Kubernetes scales.

## Installation and Getting Started

OpenEBS can be set up in a few easy steps. You can get going on your choice of Kubernetes cluster by having open-iscsi installed on the Kubernetes nodes and running the openebs-operator using kubectl.

**Start the OpenEBS Services using operator**
```bash
# apply this yaml
kubectl apply -f https://openebs.github.io/charts/openebs-operator.yaml
```

**Start the OpenEBS Services using helm**
```bash
helm repo update
helm install --namespace openebs --name openebs stable/openebs
```

You could also follow our [QuickStart Guide](https://openebs.io/docs).

OpenEBS can be deployed on any Kubernetes cluster - either in the cloud, on-premise or developer laptop (minikube). Note that there are no changes to the underlying kernel that are required as OpenEBS operates in userspace.  Please follow our [OpenEBS Setup](https://openebs.io/docs/user-guides/quickstart) documentation.

## Status

OpenEBS is one of the most widely used and tested Kubernetes storage infrastructures in the industry. A CNCF Sandbox project since May 2019, OpenEBS is the first and only storage system to provide a consistent set of software-defined storage capabilities on multiple backends (local, nfs, zfs, nvme) across both on-premise and cloud systems, and was the first to open source its own Chaos Engineering Framework for Stateful Workloads, the [Litmus Project](https://litmuschaos.io), which the community relies on to automatically readiness assess the monthly cadence of OpenEBS versions. Enterprise customers have been using OpenEBS in production since 2018. 

The status of various storage engines that power the OpenEBS Persistent Volumes are provided below. The key difference between the statuses are summarized below:
- **alpha:** The API may change in incompatible ways in a later software release without notice, recommended for use only in short-lived testing clusters, due to increased risk of bugs and lack of long-term support.
- **beta**: Support for the overall features will not be dropped, though details may change. Support for upgrading or migrating between versions will be provided, either through automation or manual steps.
- **stable**: Features will appear in released software for many subsequent versions and support for upgrading between versions will be provided with software automation in the vast majority of scenarios.


| Storage Engine | Status | Details |
|---|---|---|
| Jiva | stable | Best suited for running Replicated Block Storage on nodes that make use of ephemeral storage on the Kubernetes worker nodes |
| cStor | stable | A preferred option for running on nodes that have Block Devices. Recommended option if Snapshot and Clones are required |
| Local Volumes | stable | Best suited for Distributed Application that need low latency storage - direct-attached storage from the Kubernetes nodes. |
| Mayastor | stable | Persistent storage solution for Kubernetes, with near-native NVMe performance and advanced data services. |
