# Community Support Process

## Monthly Community Tracker

**Active tracker** -- [2021 - April Community Tracker](https://github.com/orgs/openebs/projects/31)

The OpenEBS maintainers track community support issues using the monthly Community Tracker projects. The goal of the tracker is to lubricate the support process and gather feedback. It is expected that this project will lead to faster resolution and make OpenEBS user adoption easier.

## Follow the steps below to keep the OpenEBS Community Tracker up to date with Slack:

1. **Add new issues**: Read through the [slack threads](https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/openebs) created during the duration of the month,  **E.g.** For the [2021 - April Community Tracker](https://github.com/orgs/openebs/projects/31) project, we'll look at posts created during the month of April, 2021. Add new queries as cards in the `New` section. For queries which already have their own GitHub issue, add the issue card into the `New` section. Add a link to the slack thread in the card to add context to the issue.

2. **Update existing issues**: Issues which have been engaged need to move out of the `New` section. If the slack conversation is active and progressing, move the card to the `In progress` section. If the conversation needs feedback from the user to progress, move the card to the `Waiting on user feedback` section.

3. **Reach resolution**: Issues which reach resolution should ideally have a line or two describing how it was resolved. Issues may reach resolution in one of 3 ways (4 sections)...
	- *Resolved* -- Move cards to this section when user's query has been resolved, and no code or documentation change could be recommended.

	- *Needs quick update to code / Needs quick update to docs* -- Move cards to this section if the resolution demands a change in OpenEBS code/documentation. All cards in these sections have to be linked to a GitHub issue. The cards in this section should reach the `Done` section when the issues close.

	- *Pushed into roadmap* -- Move cards to this section if changes suggested in the issue are going to be implemented at a later date, but not immediately. Discussing with the repo maintainers is a good way to find out if an issue card should be a part of the roadmap.
