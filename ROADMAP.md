# Roadmap

This document provides information on OpenEBS development in current and upcoming releases. Community and contributor involvement is vital for successfully implementing all desired items for each release. We hope that the items listed below will inspire further engagement from the community to keep OpenEBS progressing and shipping exciting and valuable features.

OpenEBS follows a lean project management approach by splitting the development items into current, near term and future categories.


## Current

These are some of the backlogs that are prioritized and planned to be completed within the next major release (e.g. OpenEBS 3.0). While the following are planned items, higher priority is given to usability and stability issues reported by the community. The completion of these items also depends on the availability of contributors.

Note: OpenEBS follows a monthly release cadence with a new minor release on the 15th of every month.  For the most current plan and status check out the [release project trackers](https://github.com/orgs/openebs/projects) or the component specific trackers listed below. This document is reviewed and updated by the maintainers after each release.

## Near Term

Typically the items under this category fall under next major release (after the current. e.g 4.0). At a high level, the focus is towards moving the beta engines towards stable by adding more automated e2e tests and updating the corresponding user and contributor documents. To name a few backlogs (not in any particular order) on the near-term radar, where we are looking for additional help: 


- Support for specifying multiple hostpaths to be used with Local PV hostpath
- Ability to migrate the Local PVs to other nodes in the cluster to handle node upgrades
- Update user documentation with reference stacks of running various workloads using OpenEBS volumes 
- Auto provisioning of block devices (on the external storage systems) that can be used with OpenEBS storage engines
- Enhancements to OpenEBS CLI (openebsctl) for better troubleshooting OpenEBS components and fixing the errors
- Setup E2e pipelines for ARM Clusters
- Conform with the new enhancements coming in the newer Kubernetes releases around Capacity based provisioning, CSI, and so forth
- Automate the workflows around handling scenarios like complete cluster failures that currently require some manual steps
- Custom Kubernetes storage schedulers to address auto-rebalancing of the data placed on the nodes to help with scale up/down of Kubernetes nodes
- User-friendly installation & configuration command-line tool (analogy to linkerd CLI for linkerd)
- Allow Mayastor Pools to incorporate more than one capacity contributing disk device
- Failed replicas should be garbage collected (return capacity to Mayastor Pool)
- Allow a new replica to be created within the same Mayastor Pool as the failed replica it replaces
- Auto-scaling up and down of cStor pools as the new nodes are added and removed
- Auto-upgrade of cStor Pools and Volumes when user upgrades control plane
- Asynchronous or DR replica for cStor and Mayastor volumes
- Support for restoring a volume (in-place) for supporting blue/green stateful deployments
- Upstream uZFS changes and start using them instead of a local fork 


## Future

As the name suggests this bucket contains items that are planned for future. Sometimes the items are related to adapting to the changes coming in the Kubernetes repo or other related projects. Github milestone called [future backlog](https://github.com/openebs/openebs/milestone/11) is used to track these requests .
