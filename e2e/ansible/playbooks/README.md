# Ansible Playbooks
-------------------

Holds test folders which contain the test playbook yaml file along with associated variable and cleanup routine yamls. 
This directory is expected to evolve to contain multiple test-categories and sub-categories. Currently contains test yamls
to deploy simple application pods - directly on the test-harness and on the kubernetes minions
