I'm running True NAS Scale with OpenEBS (Local PV) + FluxCD

### **Stateful Applications that you are running on OpenEBS**

- ownCloud
- Jellyfin
- PhotoPrism
- filebrowser
- pyLoad

### **Type of OpenEBS Storage Engines behind the above application - cStor, Jiva or Local PV?**
ZFS-LocalPV

### **Are you evaluating or already using in development, CI/CD, production**
Evaluating for Home NAS

### **A brief description of the use case or details on how OpenEBS is helping your projects.**
Very easy to set up and get to a production grade setup with proper automation, dashboards and alerts. Best thing about it I think is the transparency. There is nothing about openebs/zfs-localpv that feels like a black box and it's something important for us when we are considering deploying a storage solution.
