Openebs and MayaData start  should look at supporting pull requests (merge requests) on the public instances of Gitlab & BitBucket for Hacktoberfest 2020.

Key considerations here (to my mind):

How will the user sign up for Hacktoberfest?
Auth with GitHub, Gitlab, Bitbucket?
Spam repo logic will need to support all three providers
