# This is an input file used by the OpenEBS ansible framework to
# generate the 'hosts' file (otherwise called ansible inventory)
# It consists of multiple comma-separated lines which specify the
# machine details in the following manner :
# This is a input file used by OpenEBS for generating the hosts.
#
# This file contains the mappings of IP addresses to host names and login 
# details for that host. Each entry should be kept on an individual line. 
# The IP address should be placed in the first column followed by the 
# corresponding host name.
# The IP address and the host name should be separated by at least one
# comma.
#
# Additionally, comments (such as these) may be inserted on individual
# lines or before the machine name denoted by a '#' symbol.
#
# NOTES:
#
# 1. Please ensure supported host codes are provided, failing which
# the inventory generation will not proceed. Current supported
# codes include 'mayamaster', 'mayahost', 'kubemaster', 'kubeminion'
#
# 2. A dictionary of supported codes is present in the python script
# generate_inventory.py, which can be updated by interested users to 
# include additional hostcodes 
#
# 3. Lines can be commented (such as these) by inserting '#' symbol
# before the host code
