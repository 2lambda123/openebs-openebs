OpenEBS can be deployed in dedicated or hyper-converged mode with Kubernetes. There are serveral ways in which Kubernetes Cluster can be setup - Checkout [Kubernetes - Getting Started Guides](https://kubernetes.io/docs/getting-started-guides/). We have tested with the following deployment options. 

## Vagrant

To get started, all you need to have is an Ubuntu Host or VM with minimum RAM (8GB Free) and CPU (8 Cores Free). If you are running within VM, it needs to have VT enabled. Follow through the instructions given in the below links:
