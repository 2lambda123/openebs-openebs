# Define a new api (configuration) - openebs.io/v1aplha1
# ------------------------------------------------------
# Purspose of this configuration spec file :
# ==========================================
# OpenEBS maya is expected to identify and create the storage tiers in a given
# node or cluster. Though Maya can act on the available local storage and 
# remote storage automatically, the storage admin (human) may want to manage 
# resources manually. This config file is expected to provide such options
# 
# What should this spec cover ?
# =============================
# Include the details on how storage will be allocated for the replicas
# The options can include:
# - Manual or automatic
# - host-directory-path 
# - lvm using local or remote disks (connected via iscsi/fc/nbd)
# Will also contain details on how to use:
# - cache from nvme disks
# - backup storage from S3
# The above configuration can be specified at a cluster level or
# per node (minion) 

# The storage-manager(s) will look for updates on this spec 
# and take the appropriate actions. 

# This file will also specify the different storage tiers
# that will be used to associate with storage-classes
# For example:
# - A node can have an lvm out of SSD disks or with a remote
#   disk. The local ssd disks will be used for high-performance
#   persistentvolumeclaims, where as remote disks can be used 
#   for backup-jobs persistentvolumeclaims. 

# Define a storage pool for launching the replicas using
#  local directory or mounted directory from the minion nodes
